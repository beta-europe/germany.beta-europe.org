## Our Association

BETA is a politically independent and non-profit association founded in Germany in 2008.  Our name stands for Bringing Europeans Together Association because this is our mission: to strengthen the European society by encouraging democratic processes and consciousness about the plurality of European identities, both on national and international level. 

The expression of our goal is to actively support such political simulations as the Model European Union (MEU), events which allow young people to engage in politics, discovering the founding principles behind Europe through a first hand experience of the democratic process.

Starting from nine members, BETA has now grown to more than 500 members in 2017, involving more than 1500 youth of 33 nationalities and supporting over 20 events worldwide. 

BETA is the growing managerial infrastructure behind MEU events driven by the maximum professionalism of its members to promote learning, supporting and inspiring young European generations, in the respect of the diversities and under the sign of tolerance and inclusivity. 

## Our Values

What drives BETA is not a certain political ideology but shared values which unify our team and our actions. 

### Learning

We believe in the value of learning, especially through practice. Both through the management of the association or experiencing role-play in occasion of our political simulations, we allow to our members to experience in first person concepts which would otherwise be just printed on pages of books. Informal learning which allow to gain experience and develop soft skills. 

### Supporting

As a non-profit organisation, we want to contribute to society as much as we possibly can. In addition to running our own activities, we strive to ensure that others will be able to do the same.
We are strong advocates of the power of youth; we therefore want to help young people deliver high-quality projects and initiatives that are in accordance with our mission.

### Professionalism

We go all out to make sure that our activities are of the highest quality. Internally, we ensure that all our volunteers are supported, given the tools to succeed, learn together and enjoy their roles.
We have a highly experienced management team and we are an outstanding organisation to volunteer for. Externally, our teams aim to treat participants, partners and guests with utmost respect and professionalism.

### Tolerance and inclusivity

We believe in the power of diversity, and this starts with us. We strive towards ensuring that our activities are open to all, regardless of peopleâ€™s respective backgrounds. Tolerance and inclusivity are integral parts of the way we conduct and organise our activities as an association.

### Diversity

Although BETA is registered in Germany, we are European by nature. Our members are present in over 30 different countries in Europe and beyond. Ensuring that this diversity is also reflected within our projects and their teams is paramount for us. We will continue to value difference, making sure that our teams and participants in our activities are as diverse as they can be.

### Inspire

We want our activities to be exciting and motivating, and our members to be passionate about what they do. Our goal is to encourage young people to become active citizens and promote our goals through attending and running our events, taking part in our initiatives and engaging with our association.

## Our Mission

Strengthen the European society by encouraging democratic processes and consciousness about the plurality of European identities, both on national and international level. 

## Our Goals

**To become a leading, well-run and supportive organisation which facilitates understanding of and within Europe.** Young people need to have this knowledge in order to become active citizens in Europe and in their home countries, and we facilitate exactly that.
